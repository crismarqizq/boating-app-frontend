# Boating-app

The main idea of this is to mix technology with a field/subject I am really passionate about: the sea.  While thinking about this, I asked myself, if in Internet you can book in different sites the accomodation in-land, what about an app to book stays in port when sailing? And that is how Boating-app was born.
The user will view the available ports, check the weather on each site, add and manage boats and bookings.
